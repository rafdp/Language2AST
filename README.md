# Language2AST

High level language compiler, part of a bigger project, developed in contribution with our school class. 
This part consists of a parser, lexical analyzer and translator into standardized abstract syntax tree (AST) language 
for a lolcode-based script language.

Error management based on self-developed cascade exception system (see [ScriptCompiler](https://github.com/rafdp/ScriptCompiler)).
